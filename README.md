# What's New in 3.0

Indulged 3.0 is a completely new app, rewritten from ground. The app is now based on Windows Runtime (WinRT), unlike the previous versions which run on Silverlight. 

So what does this mean? For one thing, the app is now universal, meaning it supports a range of devices, such as Windows desktop, tablets and phones. That being said, Indulged is designed for phones, so as of version 3.0 I don't have plan to support larger devices yet.

For another thing, WinRT is a newer technology that is actually quite different than Silverlight. Migrating to WinRT allows us to drop some quircky Silverlight-only hacks needed in the previous versions. This change allows a more tight and reasonable code base. Better yet, based on my testing on my HTC 8X, the performance seems to be better than ever -- and that's only a single core device!

Last but not least, a complete rewriting allowed me more breathing time with the new 3.0 design, which I promise will be kicking a**. See for the screenshots for yourself and get "indulged" LOL :)

# The New Design

Indulged 3.0 features an overhauled design. The new design features large and clean UI, a whole new journal style layout and a more streamlined workflow. Like the previous 2.x version, the UI still contains both the white theme and the dark theme, which are deployed accordingly into each major pages. The utilization of spaceing howver, is now vastly improved. 

With the new design comes completely rewritten UI layout code. The logic is more robust than ever, and the memory usage has been reduced significantly.
